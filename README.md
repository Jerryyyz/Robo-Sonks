## How it works
Robo-Sonks can do the following:
* **Randomly React** with emojis to messages that include **6C** and **KCD** as strings in a message
* **Reply** to messages that only include **6C** and **KCD** in a message with according messages
* **kcd** command that gives you a world-renowned Sonks quote, either randomly or specified quote
* **main-theme** command sends you Robo-Sonks' main theme
* **shutthefuckup** toggle for the message replies (WIP)
* **add-quote** is for the author to add quotes to the list
* **list** to list the AI files stored for the BBCF AI
* **upload** to upload an AI file
* **request** to get a file that is stored
* *Secret function...*

## Requirements
You need to do the following in order for the bot to work properly:
* Create a directory `secret`(\Robo-Sonks\secret\) and put the token in token.txt
* Create a txt `quotes.txt` in the bot directory to put the quotes in
